    <p><i>Dear Ms. Rodriguez,</i></p>

    <p>On behalf of the Admissions Committee of the Department of Biology at Stanford University, it is with great
        pleasure that we offer you admission to our Ph.D. program, commencing in the Fall quarter of 2025.</p>

    <p>Your application impressed us tremendously. Your academic record is exemplary, and your research experience in
        marine biology, particularly your work on coral reef ecosystems, aligns perfectly with the research strengths of
        our department. We were particularly interested in your senior thesis on the impact of ocean acidification on
        coral growth, which demonstrated a strong understanding of experimental design and data analysis.</p>

    <p>As a Ph.D. student in our department, you will have the opportunity to work with world-renowned faculty, access
        state-of-the-art research facilities, and collaborate with a diverse community of scholars. You will be joining
        a vibrant intellectual community dedicated to pushing the boundaries of biological research and addressing some
        of the most pressing challenges facing our planet.</p>

    <p>To formally accept this offer of admission, please visit the following link by <strong>November 30,
            2024</strong>: [Insert Acceptance Link Here]. This link will also provide you with detailed information
